# pytest-accept

pytest-accept is a pytest plugin for automatically updating doctest outputs. It
observes generated outputs by running doctests, and writes these to the
doctests' documented outputs.

It's designed for a couple of use cases:

- People who work with doctests and don't enjoy manually copying and pasting
  generated outputs from the pytest error log into their doctests' documented
  outputs. pytest-accept does the copying & pasting for you.
- People who generally find writing tests a bit annoying, and prefer to develop
  by "running the code and seeing whether it works". This library aims to allow
  testing to become a joyful part of that development loop.

pytest-accept is decoupled from the doctests it works with — it can be used with
existing doctests, and the doctests it edits are no different to normal
doctests.

## Jesse, what the?

Here's an example of pytest-accept does: given a file like
[**`add.py`**](examples/add.py) containing an incorrect documented output:

```python
def add(x, y):
    """
    Adds two values.

    >>> add(1, 1)
    3

    >>> add("ab", "c")
    'bac'
    """

    return x + y
```

...running doctests using pytest and passing `--accept` replaces the existing
incorrect values with correct values:

```sh
pytest --doctest-modules examples/add.py --accept
```

```diff
diff --git a/examples/add.py b/examples/add.py
index 10a71fd..c2c945f 100644

```

This style of testing is fairly well-developed in some languages, although still
doesn't receive the attention I think it deserves, and historically hasn't had
good support in python.

Confusingly, it's referred to "snapshot testing" or "regression testing" or
"expect testing" or "literate testing" or "acceptance testing". The best
explanation I've seen on this testing style is from Ron Minsky in a [Jane Street
Blogpost](https://blog.janestreet.com/testing-with-expectations/).

## Installation

```sh
pip install pytest-accept
```

## What about normal tests?

A previous effort in [**`assert_plugin.py`**](pytest_accept/assert_plugin.py)
attempted to do this for `assert` statements, and the file contains some notes
on the effort. The biggest problem is pytest stops on the first `assert` failure
in each test, which is very limiting. (Whereas pytest can be configured to
continue on doctest failures, which this library takes advantage of.)

It's [probably possible to change pytest's
behavior](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/pytest-dev/2020-March/004918.html)
here, but it's a significant effort on the pytest codebase.

Some alternatives:

- Use an existing library like
  [pytest-regtest](https://gitlab.com/uweschmitt/pytest-regtest), which offers
  file snapshot testing (i.e. not inline).
- We could write a specific function / fixture, like `accept(result, "abc")`,
  similar to frameworks like rust's excellent
  [insta](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta) (which I developed some features
  for), or [ocaml's ppx_expect](https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_expect).
  - But this has the disadvantage of coupling the test to the plugin: it's not
    possible to run tests independently of the plugin, or use the plugin on
    general `assert` tests. And one of the great elegances of pytest is its
    deferral to a normal `assert` statement.
- Some of this testing feels like writing a notebook and testing that.
  [pytest-notebook](https://github.com/chrisjsewell/pytest-notebook) fully
  implements this.

## Anything else?

Not really! Some things to watch out for:

- It'll replace the file at the end of a test. So — to the extent there are
  useful changes to the file between the start and and the end of a test — it'll
  overwrite them. Passing `--accept-copy` will cause the plugin to instead
  create a file named `{file}.py.new`.
  - TODO: Should we disable the plugin on `--pdb` as one way of long-running
    tests?
  - It will overwrite the existing values, though these aren't generally useful
    — they're designed to match the results of the code.
- This is early, and there are probably some small bugs. Let me know and I'll
  attempt to fix them.
- It currently doesn't affect the printing of test results; the doctests will
  still print as failures.
  - TODO: A future version could print something about them being fixed.
- Python's doctest library is imperfect:
  - It can't handle indents, and probably other things. (We do handle blank
    lines though, and TODO: check whether the output we paste is valid doctest
    output).
  - The syntax for `.*` is an ellipsis `...`, which is also the syntax for
    continuing a code line, so it can't be at the start of a line.
  - The syntax for all the directives is arguably less than aesthetically
    pleasing.
  - It reports line numbers incorrectly in some cases — two docstring lines
    separated with continuation character `\` is counted as one, meaning this
    library will not have access to the correct line number for doctest inputs
    and outputs.
