# pytest-accept Remaining Testing Gaps

## ✅ Completed (High Priority)

1. **Error Handling in Assertion Rewriting** - See `test_assertion_filtering.py`
2. **File Change Detection During Test Run** - See
   `test_file_change_detection.py`
3. **Non-Equality Operators** - See `test_assertion_filtering.py`
4. **Complex Assertion Messages** - See `test_assertion_filtering.py`
5. **AST Walking Edge Cases** - Partially covered in
   `test_assertion_filtering.py`

## ✅ Completed (Medium Priority)

### 1. Concurrent Test Execution - See `test_concurrent_execution.py`

- Test with pytest-xdist (`-n auto`)
- Verify no race conditions with global state
- Check StashKey isolation between workers

### 2. Edge Cases in Doctest Output Formatting - See `test_doctest_formatting.py`

- Test very long lines (>1000 chars) get truncated
- Test very long outputs (>1000 lines) get shortened
- Prevents editor crashes

### 3. Multiple Doctest Failures in Same Example - See `test_multiple_doctest_failures.py`

- Test `MultipleDoctestFailures` handling
- Verify all failures in multi-failure doctest are corrected

## Status

All high and medium priority testing gaps have been successfully implemented
with comprehensive test coverage.
